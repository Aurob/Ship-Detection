# Ship-Detection
This project uses Darknet/YoloV3 to identify large ships at sea from an aerial perspective.

The model was trained on large/cargo ships from satellite imagery, 111 images total. 
Each image contained 1-30 ships at varying scales. Locations included at sea, in a river/channel, and in ports/docked.

The images and annotations can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iN9oc_WDZFmCYVvfM_xLbFteMsSFW-Md?usp=sharing
